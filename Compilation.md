# Go build process

  - Compiling, assembling, and linking are the three main stages of the Go build process that are involved in translating Go source code into a binary executable file that can be run on a target platform. Here's an overview of each stage:

## Compilation

    Compilation: The first stage of the build process is compilation, which involves translating the Go source code into low-level machine code that can be understood by the processor. The Go compiler takes the source code as input and produces object files as output. These object files contain machine instructions and other data that describe the program's functions, variables, and other symbols.

## Assembling

    Assembling: The second stage of the build process is assembling, which involves translating the object code generated by the compiler into binary machine code that can be executed by the processor. The assembler takes the object files as input and produces machine code as output. The machine code consists of binary instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed directly by the processor.

## Linking

    Linking: The final stage of the build process is linking, which involves combining the object files and other dependencies into a single executable binary file that can be run on the target platform. The linker takes the object files, libraries, and other dependencies as input and produces an executable binary file as output. The linker resolves external references between different object files, combines the object files into a single binary file, and performs dead code elimination to remove any unused code.

In summary, the compilation stage translates the Go source code into low-level machine code, the assembling stage translates the object code into binary machine code, and the linking stage combines the object files and other dependencies into a single executable binary file. By understanding these stages of the build process, you can optimize your Go programs for performance and compatibility with different platforms.
